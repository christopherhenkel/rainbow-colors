## The assignment

Create a new local HTML project. Try to match the layout and colors and try to use as little CSS as possible. The colored boxes are 300 pixels wide. 

The end result should look like this:
![end result](/assignment/endresult.png)

## Submitting your work
Create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch.
Start a new **pull request**, select **one** reviewer and make sure to put the (working) **GitHub Pages URL** in the comment section. Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
